[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: kill and killall]

Let's take a look at command line basics: kill and killall.

Pressing Ctrl+C on the keyboard allows us to interrupt and terminate a process running in the foreground.

The command kill can be used to terminate a process in the background.

The process to be killed can be specified by PID, or job number if it has one.

Let's try using kill to terminate a background process.

Let's start by running a sleep process in the background.

[Type sleep 30m & ENTER]

Note the PID of sleep.

Now we can use kill to terminate the sleep process using its PID.

[Type kill <PID of sleep> ENTER]

And bash has terminated the sleep process.

The kill command achieves its purposes by sending signals to processes.

Keyboard controls such as Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z work the same way, by sending a fixed, specific signal to processes.

For example, Ctrl+C sends an INT, or intterrupt signal.

The default signal sent by kill is TERM, or to terminate. But kill can also send various other signals.

A list of signals can be displayed by the -l option for kill.

[Type kill -l ENTER]

To specify a signal to send, use either the number or the name of the signal.

Let's try sending signals with kill.

Let's start a sleep process in the background again.

[Type sleep -30m & ENTER]

Now let's send a HUP or hangup signal to sleep. This signal is sent to processes to terminate them when a terminal session is closed without exiting.

[Type kill -1 <PID of sleep> ENTER]

Note that the argument here is the number one, which stands for the HUP signal.

And we see that the sleep process is in hangup.

Finally, it is possible to send signals to multiple processes that match a specified program name or username.

Let's try to use killall to terminate multiple processes.

First, start two sleep sessions in the background.

[Type sleep 10m & ENTER]
[Type sleep 30m & ENTER]
Note that 
the two sleep processes are assigned different PIDs, and different job numbers.

Now we can use killall to terminate both sleep processes.

[Type killall sleep ENTER]

And both sleep processes are now terminated.
