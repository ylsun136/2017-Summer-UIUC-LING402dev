[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: identifying commands]

Let's take a look at command line basics: identifying commands.

There are four types of commands in bash.

A command can be an executable program, a shell builtin, a shell function, or an alias to another command.

It is often useful to identify the type of a command.

To do that, use the type command.

Let's try to find out the types of a few commands we have used so far.

(The results of type may vary depending on system setup. The following are from Shotts.)

[Type type cat ENTER]

cat is an executable program in the directory /bin.

[Type type cd ENTER]

cd is a shell builtin.

[Type type ls ENTER]

ls is an alias for the command ls with the --color=tty option.

There are sometimes multiple versions of an executable program installed on a system.

To see the exact location of an executable program, use the which command.

[Type which grep ENTER]

which shows that the grep command we are using is the executable program called grep in the /bin directory.

which only works on executable programs, not shell builtins or aliases.

Let's try to use which on a shell builtin like cd.

[Type which cd ENTER]

This results in an error message.
