[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: aspell]

Let's take a look at command line basics: aspell.

aspell is an interactive spelling checker.

To demonstrate aspell, we first create a text file with spelling errors.

[Type cat > foo.txt ENTER]
[Type The quick brown fox jimped over the laxy dog.ENTER Ctrl+D]

This file has two spelling errors, 'jimped' and 'laxy'.

Let's use aspell to check foo.txt.

[Type aspell check foo.txt ENTER]

As aspell finds a spelling error, it will halt and display a list of suggestions, and waits for the user to input a choice.

Let's choose 'jumped' by pressing one.

[Press 1]

aspell has replaced the error with our choice, 'jumped', and moved to the next error.

This will continue till the end of the file.

Now that aspell is finished, let's examine the content of foo.txt.

[Type cat foo.txt ENTER]

See that both spelling errors have been corrected.

aspell is capable of spellchecking different kinds of text files.

For example, we can spell check an html file, with the -H mode option.

[Type aspell -H check foo.html]

The -H or html checking mode will allow aspell to recognize html tags and not flag them as spelling mistakes.
