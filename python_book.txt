chapter 5: modules

> last year there was a bit of initial frustration with e.g. not able to call tokenizer due to how nltk modules load, but we probably don't need this chapter, just a bit of FAQ.

chapter 15: recursion

> the concept is important, we had a homework on mergesort, most other homework did not call for recursion.

------------------------------------------

> this online book does not cover testing. I think it is very practical to learn about automated testing, and I really appricated the inclusion of unit testing last year.

> I'm slightly worried about the turtle graphic being introduced so early in this book. it might come back in later chapters and haunt us.
