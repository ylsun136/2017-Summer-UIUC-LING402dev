[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: using history]

Let's take a look at command line basics: using history.

Bash keeps a history of commands that have been entered.

We have learned to use the up and down arrow keys to access commands in the history.

Now let's see a few more commands to use with the history.

To get the previous command in the history, press Ctrl+p.

[Press Ctrl+p]

The previous command is copied to the current command line prompt and ready for execution.

To get the next command in the history,
 press Ctrl+n.

[Press Ctrl+n]

We can also access the first and last commands in the history.

To get the first command in the history, press Alt+open angled bracket, or the 'less than' key.

[Press Alt+<]

The first command in the history is copied to the current command line prompt and ready for execution.

To get the last command in the history, press Alt+close angled bracket, or the 'larger than' key.

[Press Alt+>]

We are back to the current command line.

The contents of the history list can be viewed using the history command.

Let's try viewing the command history.

[Type history ENTER]

This brings us to the end of the history list, where we see the most recent commands.

To see the beginning of the history list, we can pipe the output of history to a viewing program, such as less.

[Type history | less ENTER]

Now we see the beginning of command history.

[Press q to quit less]

To search the command history, we can pipe the output of history to a pattern matching program, such as grep.

Now let's try to find the commands dealing with the directory /usr/bin.

[Type history | grep /usr/bin ENTER]

And the results show all the commands containing '/usr/bin', with line numbers.

We can reverse search the history list incrementally, from the most recent commands backwards, by pressing Ctrl+r.

Let's try searching the history incrementally.

[Press Ctrl+r]

The prompt changes to 'reverse-i-search' because we are searching backwards into past commands.

Now type some search text.

As soon as we start typing, the incremental search mechanism will start showing the most recent command matching the search text.

[Type /usr/bin]

Once we finish typing the search text, the most recent matching command will be displayed.

We can execute the command right away by pressing Enter.

Or we can copy the command to the current command line by pressing Ctrl+j.

Let's try copying this command.

[Press Ctrl+j]

The command is copied to the command line and ready for execution.

We can also reverse search the history non-incrementally by pressing Alt+p.

This search will not display results as search text is entered.

You need to type in the search text and press Enter.

And the first matching command will be copied to the current command line.

Let's use non-incremental reverse search on the history.

[Press Alt+p]

The prompt now shows a colon.

Let's type our search string.

[Type /usr/bin ENTER]

The most recent matching command is copied to the current command line and ready for execution.

To forward search the history, from the oldest command to the newest, press Alt+n.

This is also an non-incremental search.

To use it effectively, we need to first move to the beginning of the history by pressing Alt+open angled bracket.

Let's use forward search on the history.

First, get to the first command in the history by pressing Alt+open angled bracket.

[Press Alt+<]

Now we can perform a forward search.

[Press Alt+n]

The prompt now shows a colon.

Let's type our search string.

[Type /usr/bin ENTER]

The oldest command containing /usr/bin is copied to the current command line and ready for execution.

To execute the current command in the history and advance to the next command in the list, press Ctrl+o.

This is useful when we want to re-execute a sequence of commands from the history.

Let's use try to re-execute the first two commands in the history.

First, get to the beginning of the history by pressing Alt+open angled bracket.

[Press Alt+<]

Now execute it by pressing Ctrl+o.

[Press Ctrl+o]

Now the second command in the history is copied to the current command line and ready for execution.

Pressing Ctrl+o again to execute the second command in the history.

[Press Ctrl+o]

Finally, we can also use the line numbers to repeat any command in the history.

This is done through history expansion, by adding an exclamation mark before a line number.

Let's try history expansion with command number <your preferred number>.

[Type !<your preferred number here> ENTER]

bash has expanded the number into the contents of the <your preferred number>-th line in the history list and executed it.

We can also use history expansion rather than the up arrow to access the last command.

To do this, use two exclamation marks.

[Type !! ENTER]

bash has expanded this into the contents of the last command in the history list and executed it.

History expansion also allows a search string instead of a number.

To repeat the most recent command that starts with a search string, add an exclamation mark before the search string.

[Type !ls ENTER]

bash has expanded this into the most recent command that starts with ls, and executed it.

To repeat the most recent command that contains a search string, add an exclamation mark and a question mark before the search string.

[Type !?/usr/bin ENTER]

bash has expanded this into the most recent command that contains the string /usr/bin, and executed it.
