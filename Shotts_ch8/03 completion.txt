[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: completion]

Let's take a look at command line basics: completion.

Completion is a mechanism that will fill in an incomplete command when the tab key is pressed.

Let's see how completion works.

We start by typing a ls command, but not finishing with a full directory name.

[Type ls /usr/b]

Without pressing the Enter key, press the tab key.

[Press tab]

The sub-directory name 'bin' has been completed.

If there is more than one entity that matches the partial name given, completion will not be successful.

Let's try completion again.

[Type l]

Still without pressing the Enter key, press the tab key.

[Press tab]

This time there is no completion, because 'l' matches to multiple things in the /usr/bin directory.

To see all possible completions, we can use the key combination Alt+the question mark,

or just press the tab key a second time.

[Press tab]

We get a list of names starting with 'l' in the /usr/bin/ directory.

For successful completion, the partial name needs to be unambiguous.

[Continue to type s]

Now try completion again by pressing the tab key.

[Press tab]

The completion is successful.

Completion also works for commands in the same way, but only for the first word on the line.

Let's now see command completion.

[Delete current line]
[Type typ]

Now press the tab key to complete the command.

[Press tab]

Completion has completed the command 'type'.
