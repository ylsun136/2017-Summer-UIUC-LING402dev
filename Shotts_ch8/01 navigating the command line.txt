[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: navigating the command line]

Let's take a look at command line basics: navigating the command line.

It is possible to navigate the command line efficiently using the keyboard.

We have learned that the left and right arrow keys moves the cursor backward and forward by one character.

Let's now try more command line navigation key combinations.

[Type cd /usr/bin]

The cursor is now at the end of this line.

We can move the cursor to the beginning of the line by pressing Ctrl+a.

[Press Ctrl+a]

The cursor is now at the beginning of this line.

We can also move the cursor to the end of the line by pressing Ctrl +e.

[Press Ctrl+e]

The cursor is back at the end of the line.

We can move the cursor backward one character by pressing Ctrl+b.

This is the same as the left arrow key.

[Press Ctrl+b]

The cursor is now at the character 'n' in 'bin'.

To move the cursor forward one character, press Ctrl+f.

This is the same as the right arrow key.

[Press Ctrl+f]

The cursor is back at the end of the line.

We can also move the cursor backward one word by pressing Alt+b.

This key combination moves the cursor to the beginning of the word to the left of the cursor.

This is particularly useful if we want to edit part of the command.

[Press Alt+b]

The cursor is now at the beginning of the word 'bin'.

[Press Alt+b]

The cursor is now at the beginning of the word 'usr'.

We can move the cursor forward one word by pressing Alt+f.

This key combination moves the cursor to the end of the word to the right of the cursor.

[Press Alt+f]

The cursor is now at the end of the word 'usr'.

Finally, we can quickly clear the screen by pressing Ctrl+l.

This is the same as the clear command, but fewer keystrokes.

Let's first execute a few commands.

[Press ENTER]
[Type ls ENTER]

Now let's use Ctrl+l to clear the screen.

[Press Ctrl+l]

The screen is cleared and the cursor is moved to the top left.
