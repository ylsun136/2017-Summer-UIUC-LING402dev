[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: editing the command line]

Let's take a look at command line basics: editing the command line.

We know that the backspace key deletes one character to the left of the cursor.

However, there are more ways to edit the command line efficiently using the keyboard.

Let's now try some command line editing key combinations.

First, we can delete the character at the cursor location by pressing Ctrl+d.

This is the same as pressing the Delete key.

This is particularly useful when used together with navigation key combinations.

[Type cd /usr/bin]

The cursor is now at the end of this line.

Suppose that instead of using cd, we now want to use the command ls instead.

Rather than pressing the left arrow or the backspace key multiple times, we can first move the cursor to the beginning of the line by pressing Ctrl+a.

[Press Ctrl+a]

The cursor is now at the beginning of the line.

Then delete the cd command by pressing Ctrl+d twice.

[Press Ctrl+d twice]

And type in ls.

[Type ls]

We have edited the command with a few keystrokes.

We can also switch the character at the cursor location with the one proceding it, by pressing Ctrl+t.

If the cursor is at the end of the line, pressing Ctrl+t will switch the two characters before the cursor.

This is a useful way to fix typos in commands, especially typos at the end of a command.

[Press Alt+f to put the cursor at the end of 'usr']
[Change 'usr' to 'urs']

Now there is an error in the middle of the directory name.

To fix this error, we need to switch characters 'r' and 's'.

First, place the cursor before the character 's'.

[Move the cursor to before 's']

The cursor position is now at the character 's'. We can use Ctrl+t to switch it with the preceding character 'r'.

[Press Ctrl+t]

Now characters 'r' and 's' are switched.

Similarly, we can switch the word at the cursor with the word preceding it, by pressing Alt+t.

If the cursor is at the end of the line, pressing Alt+t will switch the last two words before the cursor.

Let's try to switch the two words in the directory name.

First, place the cursor at the beginning of the word 'bin'.

[Move the cursor to the word 'bin']

The cursor position is now at the word 'bin'.

[Press Alt+t]

Now the words 'usr' and 'bin' are switched.

It is also possible to change the case of characters in the command line using the keyboard.

To convert characters from the cursor location to the end of the word to uppercase, press Alt+u.

Let's try to change the directory in the command to uppercase.

First, place the cursor at the beginning of the directory name.

This can be done easily with using Alt+b twice.

[Press Alt+b twice]

The cursor is now at the beginning of the word 'bin'.

Now we can convert the word 'bin' to uppercase with Alt+u.

[Press Alt+u]

Now the word 'bin' is in uppercase.

And the cursor is at the beginning of the word 'usr'.

[Press Alt+u again]

And pressing Alt+u again converts the word 'usr' to uppercase as well.

To convert characters from the cursor location to the end of the word to lowercase, press Alt+l.

Let's change the directory name back to lowercase.

First, place the cursor back at the beginning of the directory name.

[Press Alt+b twice]

By pressing Alt+b twice, the cursor is back at the beginning of the word 'bin'.

Now press Alt+l twice.

[Press Alt+l twice]

Both words 'bin' and 'usr' are now in lowercase.

Finally, it is possible to cut and paste text from and into the command line.

In bash terms, cutting text is called killing, and pasting text is called yanking.

Cut text is stored in what is called the kill-ring.

First, to kill text from the cursor location to the end of the line, press Ctrl+k.

Let's now try cutting the current line of command.

First, put the cursor to the beginning of the line with Ctrl+a.

[Press Ctrl+a]

The cursor is now at the beginning of the line.

And we can kill this entire line with Ctrl+k.

[Press Ctrl+k]

The line of text is cut.

To paste or 'yank' text, press Ctrl+y.

Let's now try yanking the line we just killed.

[Press Ctrl+y]

And we get back the line of text.

We can also kill text from the cursor location to the beginning of the line by pressing Ctrl+u.

Now let's try killing the current line again.

The cursor is at the end of the line, so we can use Ctrl+u.

[Press Ctrl+u]

The line is cut.

Now let's yank it again with Ctrl+y.

[Press Ctrl+y]

And we get back the line of text.

We can kill text from the cursor location to the end of the current word by pressing Alt+d.

Let's try killing the word 'bin' from the directory.

First, place the cursor at the beginning of the word 'bin'.

[Move cursor to before 'b']

The cursor is now at the beginning of the word 'bin'.

Let's kill the word 'bin' with Alt+d.

[Press Alt+d]

We have cut the word 'bin' out of the directory.

Let's paste back the word 'bin' with Ctrl+y.

[Press Ctrl+y]

To kill text from the cursor location to the beginning of the current word, press Alt+backspace.

Let's 
try killing the word 'bin' again.

The cursor is at the end of the word 'bin', so we can use Alt+backspace.

[Press Alt+Backspace]

We have cut the word 'bin' out of the directory.

Let's paste it at another position.

[Delete the first /]
[Press Ctrl+e]
[Type SPACE /]

Now the cursor is at the end of the line, after the slash.

And we can yank the word 'bin' here with Ctrl+y.

[Press Ctrl+y]

The word 'bin' is yanked to the end of the line.
