[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: the environment]

Let's take a look at command line basics: the environment.

The environment is a body of information maintained by bash during a shell session.

To see what is in the environment, use the printenv command.

[Type printenv | less ENTER]

This output shows us a list of environment variables and their values.

For example, there is a variable called USER.

[Highlight the USER line in the output]
[Press q to quit less]

printenv can also list the value of a specific variable given its name.

Let's list the value of the environment variable called USER.

[Type printenv USER ENTER]

The command set also displays the contents of the environment, and sorts its output in alphabetical order.

[Type set | less ENTER]
[Press q to quit less]

The command echo can also be used to view the value of an environment variable.

With echo, the name of the environment variable needs to be preceded by the dolloar sign.

Let's use echo to look at the value of an environment variable named HOME.

[Type echo $HOME ENTER]

Neither printenv nor set lists aliases. To see aliases in the environment, use the alias command without arguments.

[Type alias ENTER]
