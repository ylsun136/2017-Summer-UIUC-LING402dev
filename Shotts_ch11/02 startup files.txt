[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: startup files]

startup files are configuration scripts read by bash at the start of a session. bash uses startup files to establish the default environment shared by all users, and also to define the personal environment for the user.

The most common startup files are bashrc and profile.

Most startup files are hidden and have names starting with a period. To see them, use the -a option when using ls.

Let's use ls -a to see what startup files are installed.

[Type ls -a /etc ENTER]

The /etc directory contains global startup files for all users.

See that the output lists files like /etc/profile and /etc/bash.bashrc.

[Type ls -a ENTER]

The user's personal directory contains personal startup files.

See that the output lists files like ~/.bash_profile, ~/profile, and ~/.bashrc.

We can also examine the contents of a startup file, such as the user's personal ~/.bash_profile.

[Type less ~/.bash_profile ENTER]

The first lines beginning with the hash symbol # are comments, and are not read by bash.

Let's look at the first line that does not begin with the hash symbol.

[Highlight if [-f "${HOME}/.bashrc" ]; then ... block]

This sequence means if there is a .bashrc file in the user's directory, then read that .bashrc file.

Let's now look at the next part dealing with the environment variable named PATH.

[Highlight the part where the private /bin of the user is added to PATH]

This modifies the value of the environment variable PATH by appending the user's private /bin directory to it.
