[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: modifying the environment]

Let's take a look at command line basics: modifying the environment.

To customize the environment, edit the startup files.

Edits should be limited to personal startup files in the home directory, and always make a backup copy before editing.

As a general rule, to add directories to the PATH variable, or to define additional environment variables, edit .bash_profile.

All other changes go to .bashrc.

To edit a startup file, we can use a text editor program, such as vim.

Let's try to customize .bashrc.

First, make a copy of .bashrc and name it .bashrc.bak.

[Type cp .bashrc .bashrc.bak]

Now start the editor.

[Type vim .bashrc ENTER]

Navigate to the end of the file by pressing Shift+g.

Add the following lines:

[Type # alias to display a long format directory listing ENTER]
[Type alias ll='ls -l --color=auto']

The alias command creates a new command called ll, which displays a long format directory listing.

The line beginning with the hash symbol # is a comment.

As good practice, always add comments to new commands to make them easier to understand for other people.

Commenting is also a handy way to preserve optional configurations in the startup file when they are deactivated.

The optional commands can be commented out with the hash symbol when not needed, and the hash symbol can be removed when the commands are to be activated.

Finally, press :x to save the changes and exit vim.

Since startup files are only read at the beginning of a bash session, we need to terminate the current session and start a new one for the changes to take effect.

However, we can also force bash to re-read the .bashrc with the source command.

[Type source .bashrc ENTER]

Now we can use the new alias ll to display a long directory listing.

[Type ll ENTER]

Since the alias is defined in a startup file, it will still be available for use if we terminate the current bash session and start a new one.
