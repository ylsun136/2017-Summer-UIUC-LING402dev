[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: echo]

Let's take a look at command line basics: echo

The command echo takes zero or more strings, and displays them to the screen, separated by spaces.

[echo hello]

As we can see, echo printed the string hello.

[echo hello world]

If we provide more than one string to echo, it will print each string, and will put a single space between each pair of strings.

[echo hello      world]

If we want to print a string, preserving all spacing and other formatting, we can enclose the string in quotation marks. 

When we do this, echo will treat everything within the quotation marks as a single string.

[echo "Hello,     world    .   How are    you       today???"
