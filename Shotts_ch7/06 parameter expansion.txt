[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: parameter expansion]

Let's take a look at command line basics: parameter expansion.

Parameter expansion is an expansion for the dollar sign character, followed by text that is not enclosed in double parentheses.

The text following the dollar sign character commonly refer to variable names.

Variables are chunks of data that are stored and given names, and their values can change. 

Let's try to use echo to see how parameter expansion works.

[Type echo $USER ENTER]

The variable named uppercase USER is used by the system to store your username.

[Highlight $USER in the command]

And preceding it by the dolloar sign

[Highlight $ in the command]

creates a parameter expansion that has expanded to the value of the variable USER stored in the system.

Without the preceding dollar sign, bash will treat uppercase USER as text, rather than a variable name.

And will not do parameter expansion.

[Type echo USER ENTER]

See that using echo USER without the dollar sign will display the text uppercase USER,

[Highlight USER in the output]

not the value of the variable named uppercase USER.

[Highlight the user name in the previous output]

It is possible to create your own variables,

and use them in parameter expansion.

Let's try to create a variable and give it a value.

[Type class_code=LING402 ENTER]

Here we have created a variable, named lowercase class underscore code

[Highlight class_code in the command]

and given it a value of uppercase LING 402.

[Highlight =LING402 in the command]

Now we can use this variable name in parameter expansions.

[Type echo This class is $class_code ENTER]

And see that the variable name class_code has been expanded to the value we have given to class_code.

If a variable name is not found during parameter expansion, we get an empty string.

[Type echo This class is $class ENTER]

See that This class is has been displayed by echo.

However, in the parameter expansion of $class, there is no variable named lowercase class.

So we get an empty string after This class is.

Variables and parameter expansions are very important concepts for shell scripting.
