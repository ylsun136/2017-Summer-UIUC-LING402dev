[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: command substitution]

Let's take a look at command line basics: command substitution.

Command substitution allows us to use the output of a command as an argument of another command.

This is done by using the dolloar sign character, followed by a pair of single parentheses,

[Type echo $()]

And the command whose output we want to use, in the parentheses.

[Type ls between the parentheses]
[Highlight ls]
[Press ENTER]

Here, we have first executed the command ls, to output a list of items in the current working directory.

[Highlight ls in the command]

Command sustitution then uses this output from ls,

[Highlight $(ls) in the command]

as the argument of echo.

[Highlight echo in the command]

So echo displays a list of items in the current working directory.

Note that command substitution is different from piping.

Piping allows us to redirect the output of one command to the *standard input* of another command.

For example, a pipeline can be used to pipe the output from ls to the input of sort.

But if we reverse the direction the pipeline, and try to pipe the output of sort to the input of ls, it would have no effect on ls.

Because ls does not make use of standard input.

On the other hand, command substitution allows us to use the output of one command as the *argument* of another command.

Therefore, if we wish to configure the behavior of a command such as ls, with the output of another command,

we would use command substitution, *not* piping.

Let's try to use command substitution as an argument of ls.

[Type ls -l $(which cp)]

In this command, we want to make a long listing with ls.

[Highlight ls -l in the command]

The directory we want to examine with ls, is an argument to ls.

And we have used command substitution to replace it with the output of which cp.

[Highlight $(which cp)]

which cp is a command that will output the full path of the shell command cp.

So, ls will use the full path of the shell command cp as its argument.

And the output a long listing of the shell command
