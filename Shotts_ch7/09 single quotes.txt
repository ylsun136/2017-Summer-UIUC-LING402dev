[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: single quotes]

Let's take a look at command line basics: single quotes.

Quoting is a mechanism to suppress unwanted expansions.

Single quotes is one type of quoting. Text is placed inside singlequotation marks.

[Type 'nothing expands in these']

Single quotes suppress *all* expansions.

[Delete 'nothing expands in these']

Let's see the effect of single quotes in commands.

[Type echo 'text ~/*.txt {a,b} $(echo foo) $((2+2)) $USER']

In this command, there is ordinary text,

[Highlight text in the command]

tilde expansion,

[Highlight ~ in the command]

pathname expansion,

[Highlight *.txt in the command]

brace expansion,

[Highlight {a,b} in the command]

command substitution,

[Highlight $(echo foo) in the command]

arithmetic expansion,

[Highlight $((2+2)) in the command]

and parameter expansion.

[Highlight $USER in the command]

But they are all within a pair of single quotes.

[Highlight the two ' in the command]

Therefore, no expansion at all will happen.

[Press ENTER]

See that all the special characters,

[Highlight ~, *, { and $ in the output]

and expressions remain as ordinary text in the output.
