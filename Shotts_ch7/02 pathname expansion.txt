[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: pathname expansion]

Let's take a look at command line basics: pathname expansion.

Bash is capable of performing certain types of expansions.

Let's try to use ls to see how pathname expansion works.


[Type ls /usr/include/*.h ENTER]

This wildcard

[Highlight *.h in the command]

has been expanded into a listing of all file names that end in .h in the specified directory.


Let's try to use wildcards in directory names.

[Type ls /usr/bin/py* ENTER]

This wildcard

[Highlight /usr/bin/py* in the command]

will expand into a listing of all items under the directory /usr/bin that start with py.


Another type of expansion involves the tilde character.

[Type ~]

When the tilde character is used at the beginning of a user name, it expandes into the name of the home directory of the user of that name.

[Delete ~]

Let's try to use echo to see how tilde expansion works.

[Type echo ~<existing user name> ENTER]

This has been expanded into the home directory of the named user.

If no user name is supplied after the tilde character, it expands into the home directory of the current user.

[Type echo ~ ENTER]

See that the tilde character has been expanded into the home directory of the current user.
