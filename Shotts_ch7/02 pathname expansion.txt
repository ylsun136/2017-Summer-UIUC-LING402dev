[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: pathname expansion]

Let's take a look at command line basics: pathname expansion.

Pathname expansion is how wildcard characters, such as *, ?, and [[:alpha:]],

[Type * ? [[:alpha:]] ]

work. The shell expands these characters into listings of file or directory names.

[Delete * ? [[:alpha]] ]

Let's try to use echo to see how pathname expansion works.

# From here on arguments may be varied to suit the contents of the actual wd. Ideally we want a small amount of output, so the original command typed would be visible together with the output.

[Type echo *.txt ENTER]

This wildcard

[Highlight *.txt in the command]

has been expanded into a listing of all file names that end in .txt, in the current working directory.

Let's try to use wildcards that specify a class of characters.

[Type echo [[:upper:]]* ENTER]

This wildcard

[Highlight [[:upper:]]*]

has been expanded into a listing of all items in the current working directory, that starts with an uppercase character.

Let's try to use wildcards in directory names.

[Type echo /usr/* ENTER]

This wildcard

[Highlight /usr/* in the command]

has been expanded into a listing of all items under the directory /usr.
