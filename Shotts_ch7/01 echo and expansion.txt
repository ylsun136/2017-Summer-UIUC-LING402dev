[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: echo and expansion]

Let's take a look at command line basics: echo and expansion.

The command echo takes a line of text as its argument, and displays it to the screen.

Let's take a look at echo's man page.

[Type man echo ENTER]
[Press q to exit man]

Let's try to use echo

[Type echo]

to display a simple line of text.

[Continue to type this is a test ENTER]

See that the line we just typed is displayed.

However, when there are special characters in the line of text, echo does something else.

Let's try to use echo

[Type echo]

with a wildcard character, *, as the argument.

[Continue to type *ENTER]

echo did *not* display the character * itself.

Instead, it displayed a listing of files in the current working directory.

This is because, before the echo command is executed, the shell has *expanded* the wildcard character *, into a list of file names in the current working directory.

# here we may want to mention that if the expansion found no matching items, echo will display the argument as text

It is very important to understand how shell carries out expansion for different kinds of special characters.

And echo is a good way to observe the effects of different special characters and expansions, before we use these special characters with other commands.
