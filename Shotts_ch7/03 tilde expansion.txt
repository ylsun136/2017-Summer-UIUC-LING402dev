[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: tilde expansion]

Let's take a look at command line basics: tilde expansion.

Tilde expansion is a special expansion for the tilde character.

[Type ~]

When the tilde character is used at the beginning of a user name, it expandes into the name of the home directory of the user of that name.

[Delete ~]

Let's try to use echo to see how tilde expansion works.

[Type echo ~<existing user name> ENTER]

This has been expanded into the home directory of the named user.

If no user name is supplied after the tilde character, it expands into the home directory of the current user.

[Type echo ~ ENTER]

See that the tilde character has been expanded into the home directory of the current user.
