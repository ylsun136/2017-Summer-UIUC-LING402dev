[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: bracket expressions]

Let's take a look at command line basics: bracket expressions.

Using brackets in regular expressions allow us to match a single character from a specific set of characters.

To specify a set of characters to match from, use square brackets to enclose them.

Let's try a bracket expression.

We will use a text file that contains alphabetically sorted words.

[Type less /usr/share/dict/words ENTER]

Each word is one line of text.

[Press q to exit less]
[Type grep 'gr[ea]t' /usr/share/dict/words --color ENTER]

This command has matched all lines that contain either 'gret' or 'grat'.
 
Note that it will not match a line that contains 'great'.

Because only one character from the set enclosed in brackets is matched.

To specify a set of character that should *not* be matched at a given position, use the caret as the first character after the opening bracket.

Let's try a bracket expression with a caret.

[Type grep 'gr[^ea]t' /usr/share/dict/words --color ENTER]

This command has matched all lines that contain g, r, any character that is not e or a, and t, in that order.

Note that the caret must be inside the bracket.

We can also a specify a range of characters inside brackets.

[Type grep '^[A-Z]' /usr/share/dict/words --color]

This command will match line that starts

[Highlight ^]

with an uppercase character.

[Highlight [A-Z] ]
[Press ENTER]

And we can see that grep has indeed listed all lines that start with an uppercase character.

Note that since the dash character is used to specify a range of characters in bracket expressions,

if we want to actually match a dash character, it needs to be the *first* character in the bracket expression.

We can also use character classes enclosed in brackets and colons, such as,

[Type [:upper:]]

in bracket expressions,

as we used them on the bash command line.

[Type grep '^[[:upper:]]' /usr/share/dict/words --color]

This command will match lines that starts with an uppercase character, as defined by the character class upper

[Highlight [:upper:]]

in the bracket expression.

[Highlight the outer brackets]
[Press ENTER]

And we see that grep has indeed listed all lines that start with an uppercase character.
