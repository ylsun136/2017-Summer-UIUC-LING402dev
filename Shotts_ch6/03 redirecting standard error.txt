[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirecting standard error]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirecting standard error.

The redirection operators

[Type > >>]

only redirect standard output. They do not redirect standard error.

Let's try a command that produces an error and redirects its standard output.

[Delete > >>. Type ls -l /bin/usr > ls-output.txt ENTER]

The directory /bin/usr does not exist, and an error message is displayed on the screen.

Let's examine the file ls-output.txt with less.

[Type less ls-output.txt ENTER]

The file ls-output.txt does not contain the error message we just saw. 

[Exit less]

This is because error messages are not sent to standard output, but to standard error instead, and the redirection operator we used in the command

[Highlight > in the previous command]

only redirects standard output to the file ls-output.txt.

[Type ls -l /bin/usr]

To redirect standard error, we use a numeral file descriptor, 2, immediately before the redirection operator.

[Continue to type 2>]

Standard input, standard output and standard errors are all special files, and each has a numeral file descriptor. The file descriptor of standard input is 0, standard output, 1, and standard error, 2.

Now let's try redirecting the standard error of ls to a file.

[Continue to type ls-output.txt ENTER]

Let's examine file ls-output.txt's content with less.

[Type less ls-output.txt ENTER]

See that the file ls-output.txt does indeed contain the error message from the ls command.

[Exit less]
