[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirecting standard error]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirecting standard error.

By default, the output redirection operators

[Type > >>]

only redirect standard output. They do not redirect standard error.

Let's try a command that produces an error and redirects its standard output.

[Delete > >>]
[Type ls -l /XYZ > foo.txt]

The directory /XYZ

[Highlight /XYZ in the command]

does not exist.

Execute this command,

[Press ENTER]

and an error message is displayed on the screen.

[Highlight 'No such file or directory in the error message]

Let's examine the file foo.txt with less.

[Type less foo.txt ENTER]

The file foo.txt does not contain the error message we just saw. 

[Press q to exit less]

This is because error messages are not sent to standard output, but to standard error. And the output redirection operator we used in the command

[Highlight > in the previous command]

only redirects standard output to the file foo.txt.

To redirect standard error of a command, 

[Type ls -l /XYZ]

we use a numeral file descriptor, 2, immediately before the redirection operator.

[Continue to type 2>]

Standard input, standard output and standard errors are all special files. Each of them has a numeral file descriptor. The file descriptor of standard input is 0, standard output, 1, and standard error, 2.

[Highlight 2 in the command]

Now let's try redirecting the standard error of ls to a file.

[Continue to type foo.txt ENTER]

Let's examine file foo.txt's content with less.

[Type less foo.txt ENTER]

See that the file foo.txt does indeed contain the error message from the ls command.

[Press q to exit less]
