[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Pipes]

Let's take a look at command line basics: pipes.

When the standard output of a command is directed into the standard input of another command, they form a 'pipeline'. The standard output of one command is said to 'pipe' into the standard input of the next command. A pipeline allows a series of commands to execute, and can do some fairly complex processing.

To create a pipeline, use the pipe operator, the vertical bar character on the keyboard. This is usually located above the backslash character on the keyboard.

[Type |]

Let's try piping the output of command ls,

[Delete |]
[Type ls -l /usr/bin]

using the pipe operator,

[Continue to type |]

to the input of less.

[Continue to type less]

This pipeline sends the output of the ls -l command, a long listing of the contents in /usr/bin, to less, so that we can view the listing page by page, or search.

[Press ENTER]

[Press SPACE or b to turn pages, / to search]

We may pipe the output of any command to less. This is very handy for display.

[Press q to exit less]

Let's try creating a pipeline that sorts and displays the output of ls. To do this, pipe the output of ls,

[Type ls /bin /usr/bin |]

to the input of the command sort,

[Continue to type sort]

and pipe the output of sort,

[Continue to type |]

to the input of less.

[Continue to type less]

We have created a pipeline that will list the contents of directories /bin and /usr/bin,

[Highlight ls /bin /usr/bin in the command]

sort the list,

[Highlight | sort]

and displays it page-by-page on the screen.

[Highlight | less]
[Press ENTER]
[Press q to exit less]

We can also send the ouput of a pipeline to a file with output redirection.

[Type ls /bin /usr/bin | sort > foo.txt]
[Highlight > foo.txt]
[Press ENTER]

Let's examine the content of foo.txt with less.

[Type less foo.txt]

This is the output of the pipeline, a sorted listing of the contents of directories /bin and /usr/bin.

[Press q to exit less]

It is important to remember the difference between the pipe operator and redirection operators. The pipe operator connects one command to another *command*. 

[Type command1 | command 2]

The output redirection operator connects one command to one *file*.

[Delete command1 | command2]
[Type command1 > file1]

The output redirection operator can *not* be used to connect one command to another command.
