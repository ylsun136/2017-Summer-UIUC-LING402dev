[Title Screen: Command Line Concepts: Redirecting standard output]

Let's take a look at command line concepts: redirecting standard output.

By default, the standard output of a command such as ls

[Type ls -l /etc/X11 ENTER]

displays on the screen.

To redirect the standard output of a command to a file, use the output redirection operator.

The output redirection operator is the right angle bracket character, or the 'greater than' sign, on the keyboard.

[Type >]

Let's redirect the output of the command ls with the output redirection operator,

[Delete >]
[Type ls -l /etc/X11 >]

and follow it by the name of the file.

[Continue to type foo.txt ENTER]

Here, we created a long listing of the /etc/X11 directory

[Highlight ls -l /etc/X11 in the command]

and redirected the outputs to the file foo.txt.

[Highlight > foo.txt in the command]

Note that the output does not display on the screen.

Let's examine this file's contents using less.

[Type less foo.txt ENTER]

We see that the file does indeed contain the output from the ls -l command.

[Press q to exit less]

The output redirection operator

[Type >]

always overwrites the destination file from the beginning.

Let's try redirecting the output of a different command to the same file.

[Delete >]
[Type seq 1 20 > foo.txt ENTER]

Let's examine the file's content with less.

[Type less foo.txt ENTER]

See that the file foo.txt now only contains the output of the seq command. Its old content, the output from the previous ls -l command, has been overwritten.

[Press q to exit less]

To append redirected output to a file instead of overwriting the file, we use a different output redirection operator, the double right angle bracket character.

[Type >>]

Let's append the output of the command ls -l

[Delete >>]
[Type ls -l /etc/X11 >>]

to the file foo.txt.

[Continue to type foo.txt ENTER]

Now let's examine the file's content with less.

[Type less foo.txt ENTER]

See that the file foo.txt now contains the output of the seq command,

[Highlight appropriate sections of text]

followed by the output of the ls -l command.

[Press q to exit less]
