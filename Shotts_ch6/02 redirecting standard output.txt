[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirecting standard output]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirecting standard output.

By default, the standard output of a command such as ls

[Type ls -l /usr/bin ENTER]

displays on the screen.

To redirect the standard output of a command to a file, use the output redirection operator.

The output redirection operator is the right angle bracket character, or the 'greater than' sign, on the keyboard.

[Type >]

Let's redirect the output of the command ls with the output redirection operator,

[Delete >]
[Type ls -l /usr/bin >]

and follow it by the name of the file.

[Continue to type ls-output.txt ENTER]

Here, we created a long listing of the /usr/bin directory

[Highlight ls -l /usr/bin in the command]

and redirected the outputs to the file ls-output.txt,

[Highlight > ls-output.txt in the command]

and the outputs do not display on the screen.

Let's examine the redirected output file with ls.

[Type ls -l ls-output.txt ENTER]

See from the long listing that this file has just been created,

[Highlight date and time fields in the output]

and it has content, as its length is larger than zero.

[Highlight the length field in the output]

Let's examine file ls-output.txt's content with less.

[Type less ls-output.txt ENTER]

See that the file ls-output.txt does indeed contain the output from the ls -l command.

[Press q to exit less]

The output redirection operator

[Type >]

always overwrites the destination file from the beginning.

Let's try redirecting the output of a different command to the same file.

[Delete >]
[Type ls > ls-output.txt ENTER]

Let's examine the file ls-output.txt's content with less.

[Type less ls-output.txt ENTER]

See that the file ls-output.txt now only contains the output of the ls command. Its old content, the output from the previous ls -l command, has been overwritten.

[Press q to exit less]

To append redirected output to a file instead of overwriting the file, we use a different output redirection operator, the double left angle bracket character.

[Type >>]

Let's append the output of a ls-l command

[Delete >>]
[Type ls -l /usr/bin >>]

to the ls-output.txt file.

[Continue to type ls-output.txt ENTER]

Let's examine the file ls-output.txt's content with less.

[Type less ls-output.txt ENTER]

See that the file ls-output.txt now contains the output of the ls command,

[Highlight appropriate sections of text]

followed by the output of the ls -l command.
