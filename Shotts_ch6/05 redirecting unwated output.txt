[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirecting unwanted output]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirecting unwanted output.

Unwanted output can be redirected to a special device called /dev/null.

Let's try redirecting standard error of the ls command

[Type ls -l /bin/usr 2>]

to /dev/null.

[Continue to type /dev/null ENTER]

Let's use ls to examine the effect of redirecting to /dev/null.

[Type ls -l /dev/null ENTER]

This results in an error message. No file called /dev/null has been created.
