[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: grep]

Let's take a look at command line basics: grep.

The grep command finds text patterns in files. It prints out all the lines containing a matching pattern. grep can match very complex patterns with the use of regular expressions.

Let's take a look at grep's man page.

[Type man grep ENTER]
[Press q to exit man]

Let's use grep to find all the files that have the word 'zip' in the name in the directories /bin and /usr/bin. To do this, first use ls to list the files in the directories,

[Type ls /bin /usr/bin]

and pipe the output to grep to match the pattern 'zip'.

[Continue to type | grep zip ENTER]

A list of file names containing 'zip' is displayed.

grep pattern matching is case-sensitive by default.

Let's try to list the file names in /bin and /usr/bin that contain the word 'ZIP'.

[Type ls /bin /usr/bin | grep ZIP]
[Highlight ZIP]
[Press ENTER]

We get zero matches.

To allow grep to ignore case when matching the pattern, use the -i option with grep.

[Type ls /bin /usr/bin | grep -i ZIP]
[Highlight -i ZIP]
[Press ENTER]

We get matches again now because grep -i will match the word 'zip' in all uppercase, all lowercase, or any mixed case.

If, instead of a list of lines that match the pattern, we want a list of lines that do *not* match the pattern, use the -v option with grep.

[Type ls /bin /usr/bin | grep -v zip]
[Highlight -v zip]
[Press ENTER]

We now get a sorted list of unique file names in /bin and /usr/bin that do *not* contain the word 'zip'.

To output the number of matches instead of the matching lines, use the -c option with grep.

[Type ls /bin /usr/bin | grep -c zip]
[Highlight -c zip]
[Press ENTER]

We get a number indicating the total number of file names in the To 
directories that contain the word 'zip'.

To output the names of each file that contains a match, use the -l option with grep.

[Type grep -l zip /bin/*]
[Highlight -l zip]
[Press ENTER]

We get a list of names of files in the bin directory that contain the word 'zip'.

To output the line number of the matches, use the -n option with grep.

[Type ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | grep -n zip]
[Highlight -n zip]
[Press ENTER]

We get a listing of matches, each prefixed with the line number where the match is found.

To highlight the matches in the output of grep, use the --color option. 

[Type ls /usr/bin | sort | uniq | grep --color zip]
[Highlight --color]
[Press ENTER]

We see that the occrences of the string 'zip' are highlighted in a different color in the output.
