[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirection]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirection.

Programs such as ls

[Draw a box labeled 'ls'.]

send their results to a special location, called standard output, or stdout.

[Draw a tube leading out from box 'ls', label it 'stdout'.]

Programs also send status and error messages to another location called standard error, or stderr.

[Draw a tube leading out from box 'ls', label it 'stderr'.]

By default, both standard output and standard error are linked to the screen, not saved to a disk file.

[Draw tubes 'stdout' and 'stderr' connecting into a box labelled 'screen'.]

Many programs, such as sort, also take input from a special location called standard input, or stdin.

[Draw a box labelled 'sort', a tube 'stdin' leading into it, and tubes 'stdout'/'stderr' leading out of it. Connect 'stdout' and 'stderr' of 'sort' to box 'screen'.]

By default, standard input is attached to the keyboard.

[Draw a box labelled 'keyboard' connecting into tube 'stdin'.]

Input or output redirection allows us to change where output goes and where input comes from. For example, standard output from ls can be redirected into a file on disk.

[Change the label of the appropriate box to 'file'.]

Or, standard input to sort can be redirected so that it comes from a file on disk.

[Change the label of the appropriate box to 'file'.]

Or, the standard output of ls can be set to feed into the standard input of sort.

[Wipe away both 'file' boxes.]
[Connect 'stdout' of 'ls' to 'stdin' to 'sort'].

When the standard output of a command is directed into the standard input of another command, they form a 'pipeline'. In this pipeline, 

[Gesture over boxes 'ls' and 'sort'.]

the standard output of ls is said to 'pipe' into the standard input of sort.

The function of this pipeline is that the output of command ls

[Point to 'stdout' of 'ls'.]

is sorted,

[Gesture over box 'sort'.]

and displayed on a screen.

[Point to box 'screen' connected to 'stdout' of 'sort'.]

Several commands can be put together into one pipeline.

[Draw a pipeline consisting of boxes 'ls', 'sort' and 'less', with 'stdout' of 'less' going into 'screen'.]

This pipeline takes the output of command ls, 

[Point to 'stdout' of 'ls'.]

sorts it with sort, 

[Gesture over box 'sort'.]

and displays the sorted output on the computer screen with less.

[Gesture over box 'less' and point to box 'screen' connected to 'stdout' of 'less'.]

Finally, a command such as sort,

[Point to the box 'sort'.]

that takes some input data, 

[Point to the 'stdin' tube of 'sort'.]

does something useful such as sorting to it, 

[Gesture on the box 'sort'.]

and then outputs the data,

[Point to the 'stdout' tube of 'sort'.]

is called a filter. Pipelines often make use of filters.
