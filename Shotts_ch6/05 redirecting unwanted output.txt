[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirecting unwanted output]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirecting unwanted output.

Unwanted output can be redirected to a special file called /dev/null. 

Let's try redirecting standard error of the ls command

[Type ls -l /bin/usr 2>]

to /dev/null.

[Continue to type /dev/null ENTER]

Let's use less to examine the effect of redirecting to /dev/null.

[Type less /dev/null ENTER]

This results in an error message that /dev/null is not a regular file. This is useful when we wish to supress error messages or status messages from a command and do not care to store them.
