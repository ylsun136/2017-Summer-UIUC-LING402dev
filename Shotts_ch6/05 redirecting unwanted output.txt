[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirecting unwanted output to /dev/null]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirecting unwanted output to /dev/null

Unwanted output can be redirected to a special file called /dev/null. 

Let's try redirecting standard error of the ls command

[Type ls -l /XYZ]

This directory does not exist, so ls produces an error message. 

Now, let's redirect the standard error stream of ls to /dev/null.

[Type ls -l /XYZ 2> /dev/null]

We no longer observe the error message. ls is still producing the error message, but the standard error stream of ls is being redirected to the special file /dev/null.

/dev/null is not a regular file. We can confirm this using the command file.

[Type file /dev/null]

We can also confirm this by attempting to open /dev/null using less

Let's use less to examine the effect of redirecting to /dev/null.

[Type less /dev/null ENTER]

This results in an error message that /dev/null is not a regular file. 

We can similarly use /dev/null when redirecting standard output

[Type ls /usr/bin > /dev/null]

and also when redirecting both standard output and standard error

[Type ls /usr/bin /XYZ &> /dev/null]

The use of /dev/null can be useful whenever we wish to discard the results of an output or error stream.
