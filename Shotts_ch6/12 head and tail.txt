[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: head and tail]

Let's take a look at command line basics: head and tail.

head and tail are commands that print the first and last parts of a file, respectively. By default, head prints the first ten lines of a file, and tail prints the last ten lines.

Let's take a look at their man pages.

[Type man head ENTER]
[Press q to exit man]
[Type man tail ENTER]
[Press q to exit man]

Let's create a text file and use head and tail to examine its first and last lines.

[Type ls /usr/bin | sort > foo.txt ENTER]

We can observe that foo.txt now contains a sorted list of the files in /usr/bin

[less foo.txt]

We can use head to display the first ten lines of the file.

[head foo.txt]

We can use tail to display the last ten lines of the file.

[Type tail foo.txt ENTER]

To view a different number of lines, say the first or last *five* lines of a file, use the -n option with head and tail.

[Type head -n 5 foo.txt]
[Highlight -n 5]
[Press ENTER]

These are the first five lines of foo.txt.

[Type tail -n 5 foo.txt ENTER]

And these are the last five lines of foo.txt.

head and tail can be used in pipelines.

Let's list the last seven items of the contents of the directory /usr/bin. To do this, use ls to list the contents of the directory /usr/bin,

[Type ls /usr/bin | sort]

and pipe the output to tail with the appropriate options.

[Continue to type | tail -n 7 ENTER]

These are the last seven items in the directory /usr/bin.
