[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirecting both standard output and standard error]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirecting both standard output and standard error.

Standard output and standard error of a program can be redirected to one single file. This is useful if we wish to capture all the output of a command.

To redirect both standard output and standard error from one ls command into the same file,

[Type ls /usr /bin/usr > ls-output.txt]

use the numeral file descriptors for standard error and standard output with the redirection operator.

[Continue to type 2>&1 ENTER]

Let's examine the file ls-output.txt with less.

[Type less ls-output.txt ENTER]

The file ls-output.txt contains the output of ls /usr and the error message of ls /bin/usr.

[Exit less]

The order of redirection is important. First redirect to a file,

[Highlight > ls-output.txt in the command]

then specify the file descriptors of standard output and standard input.

[Highlight 2>&1 in the command]

In newer versions of bash, we can also use the operator &> to redirect both standard output and standard error of a command to a single file.

[Type ls /usr /bin/usr &> ls-output.txt ENTER]

Let's examine the file ls-output.txt with less.

[Type less ls-output.txt ENTER]

The file ls-output.txt contains the output of ls /usr and the error message of ls /bin/usr.

[Exit less]

We can also use the append redirection operator to append standard output and standard error of a command to a single file.

[Type ls /usr /bin/usr &>> ls-output.txt]
[Highlight &>>]
[Press ENTER]

Let's examine the file ls-output.txt with less.

[Type less ls-output.txt ENTER]

The file ls-output.txt has been appended with the output of ls /usr and the error message of ls /bin/usr.

[Exit less]
