[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: Redirecting both standard output and standard error]

Let's take a look at command line basics: redirecting both standard output and standard error.

Let's begin with a command that prints to both standard output and to standard error.

[Type ls /etc/X11 /XYZ]

In this command, ls is instructed to output a list of the contents of two directories, /etc/X11, and /XYZ.

[Highlight /etc/X11 /XYZ in the command]

Directory /etc/X11 exists,

[Highlight /etc/X11 in the command]

and ls therefore prints a list of its contents to the standard output stream, which by default is attached to the screen

[Highlight listing of /etc/X11]

On the other hand, directory /XYZ does not exist,

[Highlight /XYZ in the command]

ls therefore prints an error message to the standard error stream, which is also attached to the screen.

[Highlight error message]

Using the output redirection operator and the error redirection operator, we can redirect standard output to one file and redirect standard error to a different file.

[Type ls /etc/X11 /XYZ > foo.txt 2> bar.txt]

We can examine the content of foo.txt and observe results of the ls command that were printed to the standard output stream.

Likewise, we can examine the content of bar.txt and observe the error message of the ls command that was printed to the standard error stream.

Sometimes, it can be useful to redirect the standard output and standard error streams of a command to a single file. This can be useful if we wish to capture all of the output of a command.

To redirect both standard output and standard error from one ls command into the same file,

[Type ls /etc/X11 /XYZ &> baz.txt]

we can use the redirection operator &>

[Type less baz.txt]

Observe that the file baz.txt now contains all results of the ls command, both from standard output and from standard error.

We can also use the double left angled brackets redirection operator to append standard output and standard error of a command to a single file.

[Type ls /etc/X11 /XYZ &>> baz.txt]
[Highlight &>>]
[Press ENTER]

Let's examine the file bar.txt with less.

[Type less bar.txt ENTER]

The file bar.txt has been appended with the error message from ls /etc/X11 and the output of ls /etc/X11.

[Press q to exit less]
