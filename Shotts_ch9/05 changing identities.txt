[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: changing identities]

Let's take a look at command line basics: changing identities.

(This part is perhaps not necessary for the curriculum, but included for completeness. The availability and outputs of commands in this part is highly dependent on system config.)

Sometimes it is necessary to assume the identity of another user, for example, when testing accounts.

To change identities, use the su or sudo command.

First, let's look at all the users of the current system.

User information is saved in /etc/passwd, and can be examined with cat or less.

[Type cat /etc/passwd ENTER]

The first column lists all usernames.

The su command can be used to start a shell session as another user, specified by a username and followed by a space.

If no username is specified, it is assumed that the user wants to start a root session. This is the equivalent of the command su root.

su can also be used to execute a single command in a new shell session with the -c option.

The command must be enclosed in single quotes.

Let's try to use su to execute a command.

[Type su -c 'ls -l /root/*' ENTER]

After the system executes the command, it returns to the current shell session.

The command sudo can be configured to specify which specific commands can be executed by a user assuming another identity.

Unlike su, the use of sudo does not require superuser password.

For example, the following command,

[Type sudo -u alice ls /usr/bin]

attempts to list the contents of /usr/bin as the user named alice.

If sudo has been configured to allow this, users can authenticate themselves with their own passwords, not the superuser password.

To change the owner and group owner of a file or directory, use the chown command.

This can be used to grant access to a file or directory.

Lastly, to set or change the password, use the passwd command.

[Type passwd ENTER]

The system will prompt for the current and new password for the current user.
