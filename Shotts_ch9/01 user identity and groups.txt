[Title Screen: Command Line Basics: user identity and groups]

Let's take a look at command line basics: user identity and groups.

Linux is capable of allowing multiple people to use the same system at the same time.

In order to support many users at the same time, the activities of one user must not intefere with another.

Therefore it is essential to be able to identify users, and to determine who is allowed to do what to which files and directories.

There are three ways a user can gain access to files and directories:

A user may own files and directories and have control over their access.

A user may belong to a group, and have access to files and directories that the group can access.

A user may also access files and directories that everyone has access to.

To find out your identity, use the id command.

[Type id ENTER]

The output first shows uid, or user ID.

It is a number assigned to the user when the user account was created.

[Highlight uid in the output]

And shows the corresponding username is parentheses.

[Highlight username in the output]

The next number is gid, or primary group ID.

It is a number assigned to the user's personal group.

And followed by the primary group name in parentheses.

The next entries list the IDs and names of groups that the user belongs to.

Therefore this user can access any files and directories that these groups can access.
